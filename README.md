# Welcome to the Lisa Project #

Lisa is a production-quality expert-system shell, developed atop an optimized implementation of Charles Forgy's Rete
algorithm, a very efficient mechanism for solving the difficult many-to-many matching problem[^1]. Lisa is written in
modern Common Lisp and the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), with a smattering of the Meta Object Protocol (MOP)
sprinkled about.
