(in-package :lisa)

;;; Represents the canonical form of a slot within a pattern analysed by the
;;; DEFRULE parser. NAME is the slot identifier; VALUE is the slot's value,
;;; and its type can be one of (symbol number string list) or a LISA variable;
;;; SLOT-BINDING is the binding object, present if VALUE is a LISA variable;
;;; NEGATED is non-NIL if the slot occurs within a NOT form;
;;; INTRA-PATTERN-BINDINGS is a list of binding objects, present if all of the
;;; variables used by the slot reference bindings within the slot's pattern;
;;; CONSTRAINT, if not NIL, represents a constraint placed on the slot's
;;; value. CONSTRAINT should only be non-NIL if VALUE is a variable, and can
;;; be one of the types listed for VALUE or a CONS representing arbitrary
;;; Lisp code; CONSTRAINT-BINDINGS is a list of binding objects that are
;;; present if the slot has a constraint.

;;; PARSED-PATTERN represents the canonical form of a pattern analysed by the
;;; language parser. CLASS is the name, or head, of the pattern, as a symbol;
;;; SLOTS is a list of PATTERN-SLOT objects representing the analysed slots of
;;; the pattern; ADDRESS is a small integer representing the pattern's
;;; position within the rule form, starting at 0; PATTERN-BINDING, if not NIL,
;;; is the variable to which a fact matching the pattern will be bound during
;;; the match process; TEST-BINDINGS is a list of BINDING objects present if
;;; the pattern is a TEST CE; BINDING-SET is the set of variable bindings used
;;; by the pattern; TYPE is one of (:GENERIC :NEGATED :TEST :OR) and indicates
;;; the kind of pattern represented; SUB-PATTERNS, if non-NIL, is set for an
;;; OR CE and is a list of PARSED-PATTERN objects that represent the branches
;;; within the OR; LOGICAL, if non-NIL, indicates this pattern participates in
;;; truth maintenance.
