;; Description: Meta operations that Lisa uses to support the manipulation of
;; facts and instances.

;; NB: A note on terminology. We make the distinction here between symbolic
;; slot names and effective slot names. The former refers to an internal
;; symbol, created by Lisa, used to identify fact slots within rules; the
;; latter refers to the actual, package-qualified slot name.
