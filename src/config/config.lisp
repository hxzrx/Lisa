;;; The reference guide has complete details, but:
;;;
;;; * Setting USE-FANCY-ASSERT enables the #? dispatch macro character.
;;; * Setting ALLOW-DUPLICATE-FACTS disables duplicate fact checking during
;;;   assertions.
;;; * Setting CONSIDER-TAXONOMY instructs Lisa to consider a CLOS instance's
;;;   ancestors during pattern matching.
